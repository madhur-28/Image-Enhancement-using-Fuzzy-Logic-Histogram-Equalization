# Image-Enhancement-using-Fuzzy-Logic-Histogram-Equalization
Within the realm of image processing, I have made significant contributions to a project focused on enhancing image samples  through the application of fuzzy logic and histogram equalization. This experience was gained during my tenure working on innovative projects,  emphasizing my dedication to achieving project milestones successfully.

I spearheaded the development of a pivotal Proof of Concept (POC) centred on image enhancement, employing a fusion of fuzzy logic and 
histogram equalization techniques. I successfully executed the deployment of the image enhancement algorithms, implemented in both MATLAB 
and Python. This underscores my proficiency in deployment methodologies, specifically in the context of image processing applications.
